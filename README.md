# FontGenerator

My wife works for a company called Audrey and Bear. They design and make individualized baby products for their customers.
Part of the design process allows the customer to choose a font for the name that will be on the blanket. This repository contains a simple static site that allows the designer to enter in the name of the baby and be able to send a screenshot of what the different fonts would look like.
